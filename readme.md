# Data Engineering Zoomcamp

This repository is a personal adaptation of the [DataTalks.Club Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) course. It includes custom modifications and enhancements to suit individual learning objectives.

## Overview

The Data Engineering Zoomcamp is a comprehensive course designed to teach the fundamentals of data engineering. Participants build an end-to-end data pipeline from scratch, gaining hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and best practices.

## Course Structure

The course is structured into several modules, each focusing on a key aspect of data engineering:

1. **Introduction & Prerequisites**

   - Course overview and setup instructions.

2. **Docker and Terraform**

   - Introduction to Docker for containerization.
   - Basics of Terraform for infrastructure as code.

3. **Workflow Orchestration**

   - Using tools like Airflow to manage and schedule data workflows.

4. **Data Warehouse**

   - Designing and implementing data warehouses.
   - Working with BigQuery and other data warehousing solutions.

5. **Analytics Engineering**

   - Transforming data for analytics purposes.
   - Introduction to dbt (data build tool).

6. **Batch Processing**

   - Techniques and tools for processing large batches of data.
   - Using Airflow to communicate with PySpark and BigQuery for orchestrating batch jobs.

7. **Streaming**

   - Real-time data processing concepts and tools.
